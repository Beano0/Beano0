I am an autistic programmer who works with:
JavaScript
C#
Python
HTML
CSS
Powershell

I am not the most optimal. Please do not nag me about optimisation, but you are fine to suggest better statements, such as converting a for into a foreach.
I use vscode. It's simply what I have learnt to use.
I am currently learning C# and Lua, with the idea of trying either Game dev or Software dev.

I am a college student in a BTEC Level 3 Diploma for Computer Science.

If you are curious about things, you are free to ask. If I do not respond, most likely either forgot to check here or been busy.
