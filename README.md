I am an autistic programmer who works with JavaScript, C#, HTML, CSS, and Powershell.

I am not the most optimal. Please do not nag me about optimisation, but you are fine to suggest better statements, such as converting a for into a foreach.
I use vscode. It's simply what I have learnt to use.
I am currently learning Linux, Go, Node.js and Express. I'm working on converting to Omarchy rather than a now-dead windows 10.

I am a college student in a BTEC Level 3 Nataional Extended Diploma for Information Technology.

If you are curious about things, you are free to ask. If I do not respond, most likely either forgot to check here or been busy.
